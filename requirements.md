Business needs
Background Information
MerQury Bank (I hid the Bank's real name of the Bank for the project) specializes in giving
financial products to their customers for more than a decade. So far, they have been faithful and
loyal to their customers. Even during those uncertain times, the Bank always wants to make sure
their customers get the best banking service possible.
When a customer wants to take a loan, they have to be physically present to fill out all papers.
The information is registered to an excel sheet or documents sent to a different committee for
review. The Customer has to wait for 45-60 days to get his loan approved based on the
Customer's information.
Now, the Loan Division Director wants to change things and make sure that all requests are made
online, and all processes are automated, secure, and fast. The Director seeks to reduce the time
to approve the loan. He believes this will bring more revenue and attracts more customers. The
Director has elaborated a new process and new business rules for new and existing customers.
The Director also wants a system that will manage all the loan requests from their customers.
A customer can be an individual or an organization. We have different types of loans depending
on the Customer. An individual cannot take on a loan dedicated to an organization and vice-versa.

Workflow
New Customer
1) The customer login into the application and want to request a loan. The loan can be of
different types. The Customer provides full names, addresses, mobile phone, email, date
of birth, social security number, and salaries. Once finished, the Customer needs to
upload some documents; documents can be a letter of employment, Tax Returns, etc.…
For an organization, Company name, website, address, type of company, Tax ID, the
person of contacts, etc.… Financial Reports,
2) Once the Customer has entered all this information, the Customer will need to select the
type of loan he wants, including the amount. Once He has entered that information,
depending on the loan type, the Bank will be asking Collateral to cover the loan.
3) The Collateral could be of any type, and each type required a different kind of
information. The Customer will have to upload the document related to the Collateral.
Once finished, the Customer saves the request.
4) The information is sent directly to a loan officer who reviews the information regarding
the loan. If all the information is correct, credit score check, background check, And loan
officer approve and forward it to Collateral Office to review the request. If some data are
missing, the loan officer sends a notification to the client asking for more details.
5) The Collateral officer reviews everything related to the Collateral. If the Collateral is
enough to cover the trade, he approves and forwards it to the Review Committee. If the
Collateral is not enough or more detail is needed. The Collateral officer sends a
notification to the client asking for more Collateral or information.
6) The Review Committee is the final step to this process. If all information is correct and
there is no risk, They approve the request and forward it to Treasury to do the
disbursement. If not, they reject it and send a notification to the client and the reason for
the rejection.
7) The Treasury will credit the customer account.
